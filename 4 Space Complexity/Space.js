/**
 * ^what is space complexity ?
 * 
 * ^This is how much more memory use (RAM) do we need as the inputs provided to the Code gets larger unlike,
 * ^ Time Complexity which is How much runtime do we need as inputs provided to he code gets larger 
 * 
 * ! Nte. Both of these complexities still uses Big O Notation
 * 
 * 
 * ^ RUles of Space complexities 
 * 
 * ^ ¬¬ Storing values in Variables always takes up memory.
 * 
 * ~Most Primities (booleans and Numbers ) take up 0(1)/ Constant Space Complexity
 * ~        var x = 100 & var x = 200 take up same amount of memory
 * 
 * 
 * ~ Strings, Arrays and Objects takes up 0(n)/ Linear space 
 *          ~ An array w/ 4 elements takes up twice the memory of an Array w/ 2 elements 
 * 
 * 
 * ~ why is Time Complexity prioritized Over space complexity ?
 * ^        The cost to produce and run processors are much higher compared to RAM
 * 
 * ^      Users in general care more about speed than Ram Usage
