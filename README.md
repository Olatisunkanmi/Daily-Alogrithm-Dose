-Faster Code Writing and All Problem solving skills needed for Solving Life Problems 




  !why is Big O notation important
      !also Known as Time Complexities 
 
 1. For faster and better implentation of Writing our codes
 it is important because as your codebase and user posts (database) gets larger your code needs not to run slower
 
2. BETTER implentation of your code
this means faster time to finish to use less memory (RAM), although there is a much stronger empahsis on the former.
                          ^Faster Time 
 
 ~the readabilty of your code does not factor at all PERFORMANCE is KING
              ^like  in soccer 3pt is more important than dribbles
 
  ! why is time measurements not good .
 
computers differ widely in  their processors, so you will often get diffrent times for each comp. ??
hence the time complexity of the code will not be safe to determine.

 until inputs get really large we cannot really know the how good the code is.
 if you write a bad code for your APP nobody notices right ?
 what if Microsoft does same mistake ? see!! it would cost them alot.w

*?let's write some code!
